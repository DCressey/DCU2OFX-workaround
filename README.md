# DCU2OFX-workaround  
In early March,  the DCU launched a new system on the website and the app that changed a lot of things in the user experience.  Among the changes was that DCU,no longer provides support for OFX files.  Some members may need this format.  DCU2OFX Is a script that converts a .csv file obtained from the DCU into an .ofx file with the same content.  This is a temporary workaround until a better solution becomes available.
